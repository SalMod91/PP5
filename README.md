## Business Overview
The primary objective of this project is to develop a data-driven web application that enables the client to accurately predict house sale prices based on various house attributes and provides insightful visualizations of how these attributes correlate with sale prices. This will aid the client in making informed decisions regarding the sale of four inherited properties and any future real estate investments in Ames, Iowa.

## Business Requirements

- Data Visualization Requirement: <br>
    The client requires a dashboard that displays visualizations of house attributes correlated with sale prices to understand market trends and factors influencing house values in Ames, Iowa.

- Predictive Analysis Requirement: <br>
    The client needs a robust predictive model integrated within the dashboard that can forecast the sale prices of her four inherited houses and any additional houses in Ames. <br>This model should use historical data and house attributes to generate predictions.

### Succes Metrics
**Model Performance:** <br>
    Achievement of an R2 score of at least 0.75 on both the training and testing datasets, indicating strong predictive accuracy of the model.

**Variable Correlation Analysis:** <br>
    Completion of a comprehensive study identifying and visualizing the most relevant variables that are correlated with the sale price. This includes clear documentation and presentations of these correlations through the dashboard to aid in understanding how different house attributes impact sale prices in Ames, Iowa.

**Predictive Capability:** <br>
    Successful implementation of the predictive model within the dashboard that can accurately forecast sale prices for the four inherited properties, as well as for any other house in Ames. The predictions should consistently align with actual market prices, demonstrating the model's effectiveness.

## Dataset Content

* The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/codeinstitute/housing-prices-data). We then created a fictitious user story where predictive analytics can be applied in a real project in the workplace.
* The dataset has almost 1.5 thousand rows and represents housing records from Ames, Iowa, indicating house profile (Floor Area, Basement, Garage, Kitchen, Lot, Porch, Wood Deck, Year Built) and its respective sale price for houses built between 1872 and 2010.

## Business Requirements

As a good friend, you are requested by your friend, who has received an inheritance from a deceased great-grandfather located in Ames, Iowa, to  help in maximising the sales price for the inherited properties.

Although your friend has an excellent understanding of property prices in her own state and residential area, she fears that basing her estimates for property worth on her current knowledge might lead to inaccurate appraisals. What makes a house desirable and valuable where she comes from might not be the same in Ames, Iowa. She found a public dataset with house prices for Ames, Iowa, and will provide you with that.

* 1 - The client is interested in discovering how the house attributes correlate with the sale price. Therefore, the client expects data visualisations of the correlated variables against the sale price to show that.
* 2 - The client is interested in predicting the house sale price from her four inherited houses and any other house in Ames, Iowa.

## Hypothesis and how to validate?

* List here your project hypothesis(es) and how you envision validating it (them).

## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualisations and ML tasks

* List your business requirements and a rationale to map them to the Data Visualisations and ML tasks.

## ML Business Case

* In the previous bullet, you potentially visualised an ML task to answer a business requirement. You should frame the business case using the method we covered in the course.

## Dashboard Design

### Dashboard Expectations
The dashboard should contain:

- A project summary page, showing the project dataset summary and the client's requirements.
- A page listing findings related to which features have the strongest correlation to the house sale price.
- A page displaying the 4 houses attributes and their respective predicted sale price.
- It should display a message informing the summed predicted price for all 4 inherited houses.
- It should have an interactive input widget that allows a user to provide real-time house data to predict the sale price.
- A page indicating the project hypothesis(es) and how i validated it across the project.
- A technical page displaying the model's performance.

## Unfixed Bugs

* You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

## Deployment

### Heroku

* The App live link is: <https://YOUR_APP_NAME.herokuapp.com/>
* Set the runtime.txt Python version to a [Heroku-20](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-support#supported-runtimes) stack currently supported version.
* The project was deployed to Heroku using the following steps.

1. Log in to Heroku and create an App
2. At the Deploy tab, select GitHub as the deployment method.
3. Select your repository name and click Search. Once it is found, click Connect.
4. Select the branch you want to deploy, then click Deploy Branch.
5. The deployment process should happen smoothly if all deployment files are fully functional. Click the button Open App on the top of the page to access your App.
6. If the slug size is too large then add large files not required for the app to the .slugignore file.
